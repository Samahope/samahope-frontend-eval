# Samahope Frontend Evaluation

This evaluation is meant to test frontend candidates' skill at working with 
frontend frameworks, JSON APIs, and development speed in general.

# Instructions

1. Using [this JSON](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=c6b9f27dbbdfed8e30e5dc0a9b445bda&_render=json),
render a random video from the TED library on a simple HTML page.
2. Display the title and description for the video.
3. Spend *no more than 2 hours* on this takehome evaluation.
4. Any frameworks or libraries can be used, but you need to be able to explain 
why you picked the tools you picked.
5. You won't be judged on design, but extra credit will be given for any attention
paid to layout or CSS.

**Good luck!**
