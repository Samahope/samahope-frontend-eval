# Samahope Frontend Evaluation

This evaluation is meant to test your skill at working with frontend frameworks, 
JSON APIs, and your development style and workflow in general. This evaluation
shouldn't take much more than **2 hours** to complete, so use that timebox as a 
guide for how much detail to go into. You won't be judged on
design or layout, but you'll certainly be awarded extra credit for keeping it in 
mind ;)

Using JSON data from the TED talk library, you're going to be building a
simple webpage that does the following things:

1. Plays the most recent TED talk video (see the data below).
2. Displays the title and description for this video.
3. Allows a user to click to see the next / previous videos.

## Slightly more specific instructions

1. First, fork or clone this repo.
2. Use [this JSON](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=c6b9f27dbbdfed8e30e5dc0a9b445bda&_render=json)
to access the TED talk data.
3. Any frameworks or libraries can be used, but please explain your decision.
4. Host your solution somewhere, or provide instructions for me to run your 
solution locally.
5. **Don't** submit a pull request â€” instead, email me a link to where I can view
your code and see the solution privately.

Other than the rules laid out in this readme, assume there are no other rules,
restrictions, or constraints.

**Good luck!**
